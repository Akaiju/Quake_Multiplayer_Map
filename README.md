# Layered Reality

Homebrewed multiplayer map for Quake, called Layered Reality. Competitive, free-for-all only, and made for 4 angry dudes to throw themselves at one another across two different planes of existence. Mix of long-range combat and close quarters mayhem.
See the project [wiki](https://github.com/Akaiju/Quake_Multiplayer_Map/wiki) for more info.
